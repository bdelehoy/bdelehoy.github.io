        <h5>September 2, 2018</h5>
        <p>A game made in collaboaration with Kyle Kissler for the Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam 2018 over just 3 days.  The concept is simple: a stealth game where the objective is to attract as much attention to yourself as possible.</p>

        <p>The third and final game I helped make for my Game Engine Lab, made in collaboration with Ittai Mann, Andrew Smith, and John Luke Saake.  Players are placed in a top-down, zombie-infested city and are forced to fight off the hordes, and eventually, each other.  I wrote 2 songs, created all the sound effects, and assisted in level design.</p>

        <h5>February 28, 2018</h5>
        <p>Collaboration with Juwin Viray for my Game Engine Lab.  A combination of Rock, Paper, Scissors and the classic Quick Draw games themed around fighting games.  I wrote the main theme, ambient city noise, all sound effects, and implemented nested coroutines as random countdown timers.</p>

        <h5>January 25, 2018</h5>
        <p>A simple 2D ocean exploration game, made in about one week for my first piece of Game Engine Lab coursework.  My very first foray into solo Unity/C# development.  You can play it by clicking its name above.  Please note that the game wasn't built for the web, so try downloading it instead:<br /><a href="https://mega.nz/#!YEAFiBoS!xab47N-kvHIfUzyidxcijx1hnbxYoVSsZ4dzp-JjeFw" target="_blank">Win</a> | <a href="https://mega.nz/#!tN5H2b5D!wB0vi2X0KLyRQf6_ANDv1Avd83iNGDExS-ICauNt6L0" target="_blank">Mac</a></p>
