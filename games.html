        <h5>September 2, 2018</h5>
        <p>A game made in collaboration with Kyle Kissler for the Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam 2018.<br />The concept is simple: a stealth game where the objective is to attract as much attention to yourself as possible.  You can download it by clicking on Buddy above.</p>

        <h5>March 15, 2018</h5>
        <p>The third and final game I helped make for my Game Engine Lab, made in collaboration with Ittai Mann, Andrew Smith, and John Luke Saake.  Players are placed in a top-down, zombie-infested city and are forced to fight off the hordes, and eventually, each other.  I wrote 2 songs, created all the sound effects, and assisted with level design.</p>

        <h5>February 28, 2018</h5>
        <p>Collaboration with Juwin Viray for my Game Engine Lab.  A combination of Rock, Paper, Scissors and the classic Quick Draw games themed around fighting games.  I wrote the main theme, created all sound effects, and implemented nested coroutines as random countdown timers.</p>

        <h5>January 25, 2018</h5>
        <p>A simple 2D ocean exploration game, made in about one week for my first piece of Game Engine Lab coursework.  My very first foray into solo Unity/C# development.  You can play it by clicking its name above.  Some parts might look strange in-browser, so I recommend downloading it instead:<br />

        <h5>October 27-29, 2017</h5>
        <p>An aptly titled infinite runner made for the UCI Video Game Development Club's Fall 2017 "Proto" Game Jam with team members Justin Lee, Jason Mehroziad, Timothy Quach, and Brenda Rendon.  I helped design the game and contributed all the audio.  You can download it on my <a href="https://bdelehoy.itch.io/forest-runner" target="_blank">itch.io</a> page!</p>
