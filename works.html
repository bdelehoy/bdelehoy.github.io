            <h5>January 21, 2018</h5>

            <h5>June 3, 2016</h5>
            <p>The soundtrack to another unfinished student game development project.  The game would've been a 2D puzzle platformer that takes place inside a child's dream world.</p>

            <h5>June 2, 2016</h5>
            <p>The soundtrack to an unfinished student game development project.  The game would've been a top-down action game with cute-horror elements (a la the Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy or The Binding of Isaac).</p>
            <p>There are a few more songs floating around on my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/brandon-delehoy", target="_blank">Soundcloud</a>, if you're interested.</p>

            <h3>Gameography</h3>

            <h4>Zom Bam Bros</h4>
            <h5>March 15, 2018</h5>
            <p>The third and final game I helped make for my Game Engine Lab, made in collaboration with Ittai Mann, Andrew Smith, and John Luke Saake.  Players are placed in a top-down, zombie-infested city and are forced to fight off the hordes, and eventually, each other.  I wrote 2 songs, created all the sound effects, and assisted in level design.</p>

            <h4>Punch Kick Super</h4>
            <h5>February 28, 2018</h5>
            <p>Collaboration with Juwin Viray for my Game Engine Lab.  A combination of Rock, Paper, Scissors and the classic Quick Draw games themed around fighting games.  I wrote the main theme, ambient city noise, all sound effects, and implemented nested coroutines as random countdown timers.</p>

            <h4><a href="reef_web_build/reef.html" target="_blank">Reef</a></h4>
            <h5>January 25, 2018</h5>
            <p>A simple 2D ocean exploration game, made in about one week for my first piece of Game Engine Lab coursework.  My very first foray into solo Unity/C# development.  You can play it by clicking its name above.  Please note that the game wasn't built for the web, so try downloading it instead: <a href="https://mega.nz/#!YEAFiBoS!xab47N-kvHIfUzyidxcijx1hnbxYoVSsZ4dzp-JjeFw" target="_blank">Win</a> | <a href="https://mega.nz/#!tN5H2b5D!wB0vi2X0KLyRQf6_ANDv1Avd83iNGDExS-ICauNt6L0" target="_blank">Mac</a></p>
