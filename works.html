            <p>My debut album.  TBA</p>

            <a href="https://brandondelehoy.bandcamp.com/album/prototypes-2014-2016" target="_blank"><h4>Prototypes (2014-2016)</h4></a>
            <h5>January 21, 2018</h5>
            <p>A compilation of the best songs I wrote while I attended high school, remastered for a more up-to-date sound.</p>

            <a href="https://brandondelehoy.bandcamp.com/album/dreamcatcher-original-soundtrack" target="_blank"><h4>Dreamcatcher - Original Soundtrack</h4></a>
            <h5>June 3, 2016</h5>
            <p>The soundtrack to another unfinished student game development project.  The game would've been a 2D puzzle platformer that takes place inside a child's dream world.</p>

            <a href="https://brandondelehoy.bandcamp.com/album/light-the-way-original-soundtrack" target="_blank"><h4>Light the Way - Original Soundtrack</h4></a>
            <h5>June 2, 2016</h5>
            <p>The soundtrack to an unfinished student game development project.  The game would've been a top-down action game with cute-horror elements (a la the Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy or The Binding of Isaac).</p>

            <h3>Games</h3>

            <h4>Zom Bam Bros</h4>
            <h5>March 15, 2018</h5>
            <p>The third and final game I helped make for my Game Engine Lab, made in collaboration with Ittai Mann, Andrew Smith, and John Luke Saake.  Players are placed in a top-down, zombie-infested city and are forced to fight off the hordes, and eventually, each other.  I created all the music and sound effects and assisted in level design.</p>

            <h4>Punch Kick Super</h4>
            <h5>February 28, 2018</h5>
            <p>Collaboration with Juwin Viray for my Game Engine Lab.  A combination of Rock, Paper, Scissors and the classic Quick Draw games themed around fighting games.  I learned all about coroutines here.</p>

            <h4>Reef</h4>
            <h5>January 25, 2018</h5>
            <p>A 2D ocean exploration game, made in one week for my first piece of Game Engine Lab coursework.  My very first foray into Unity/C# development and game design.</p>
